Exam 1 report RE-SIT

We we’re tasked with creating a website called Good Food Mood. Which helps people find recipes. This site you can easily browse through the different recipes. This site is for everyone who like food that puts you in a good mood.

Process:

I first started doing some research/looking at other food pages.

Planning.

Created wireframes.

Added html pages.

Fetched the API’s I wanted to use for my site.

Added functionality to the hamburger and forms.

Added styling and responsiveness with external CSS.

This project has been more an experiment. Trying out some new stuff I had not tried before. Like the video header. Not so sure about the WCAG for the header but the rest is fine.

During the research I found the food pages to kind of chaotic with a lot of colors and changing images, so I wanted to use an API to generate random images on the home page.

And I added a recipes page so the user could browse through the different recipes. It won't display the recipes or the ingredients but its more to prove a point, so I added description of the food.

The forms should display an error if not the correct value is submitted.
